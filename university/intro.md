Introduction to HTML

HTML stands for hypertext markup language. Markup is a way to indicate information about the content that is distinct from the content. There has been different version of HTML, the latest is HTML5.
To understand markup, think of an assignment you submitted to your teacher. Teacher checks it and marks it for what can be improved or which mistakes student made which can be corrected. The feedback of teacher can be thought as markup. To make distinction between assignment and markup, teacher may use different color pen.

HTML validator, a tool of W3C, is used to identify errors in an HTML page and give recommendations in the form of warnings.

15.1 HTML5

It is the latest version of HTML supported by all of the modern browsers.

15.2 Elements and attributes

An HTML document contains HTML elements, also called HTML tags. Every HTML element has a unique name which can be written after the angle bracket (<). HTML elements can also contain attributes and the content within the tag. The figure given below shows the syntax of anchor tag, an attribute of link, and content. Most of tags come in pair, means they have closing tags as well.

15.3 An empty element

An empty element does not contain any text content; instead, it is an instruction to the browser to do something.

In XHTML, empty elements had to be terminated by a trailing slash. However, the trailing slash in empty elements is optional in HTML5.

15.4 Nesting element
Developers must be careful while using nesting elements. While closing, the nested element must be closed first. The example of correct and incorrect nesting is shown below in figure 10. In figure 11, the relationship of nested tag is shown. Nested elements can also be shown in the form of tree containing roots and children (figure 12).
